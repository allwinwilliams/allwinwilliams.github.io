          <h2 class="">A brief history of me</h2>
          <p>
            I started my journey from a small agricultural town called Lalgudi in the district of Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu.
            My father does agricultural and co-owns a small bakery along with his friends while my mom takes care of our home. I have an elder brother who is currently a product developer who introduced me to computers for which I am really grateful.
            I have always been fasinated about how technology impacts people's life from my school days.
            I decided to study a technical course in college and so I did my undergrad in Information Technology from Coimbatore Institute of Technology, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. After which, I started pursuing graduate degree in Interaction Design from National Institute of Design, Bengaluru, Karnataka.
            <br /><br />
            I like watching crime thrillers while having a plate of biryani along with some coke, especially when it's raining outside.
            I also like listening to AR Rahman, and playing the piano.
