  <p>
    Soil health is important for farming. However, repeating the same crops and the large use of fertilizers deteriorates soil health over time. This in turn results in low yield for farmers.
    To maintain soil health and increase crop yield, this project uses pH, moisture, temperature, and sunlight sensors to monitor soil health and uses a machine learning module to recommend what crop to put next for maximum yield and to maintain soil health.
