    <p>Emojis have recently evolved into a language to express and heavily used across social platforms for the same reason. In this project, I am trying to explore a way towards storytelling through real-time visualiation and sonification of emojis from Twitter. It is an iteractive exploration about storytelling with a collection of data.  With the question of what does our emoji usage collectively say about us, he found an emoji live tracking data service. In order to understand this enormous data more effectively, I decided to build an emoji meter, which then further led me thinking about how best to tell a story. I extended this into a persona exploration where I have exported WhatAapp chat with a dear friend and visualised emoji usage.</p>
    <p> I have given a talk about storytelling with data at <a href="https://processingindia.com/2021/" target="_blank">Processing Community Day(PCD) India 2021</a>. The work has also been featured at <a href="https://emojitimeline.com/" target="_blank">Emoji Timeline</a>, an independent repository of everything emoji.</p>
    <p>I further extended this interest in emojis with a WhatsApp friend group. I used a python program to count emojis from my WhatsApp data and started analysing it by grouping, aggregation with different attributes. Monthly top emoji, who uses which emojis the most, etc., are some of things I counted. At the end, I drew the top 5 emojis from the group. I did at the end of our college when we were preparing for our different careers. You can find a picture of it the end of this page.</p>
