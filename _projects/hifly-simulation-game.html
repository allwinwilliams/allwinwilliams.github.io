<div class="w-100 content">
  <p>HiFly started with the goal of creating a novel interface which keeps the user physically engaging. We wanted it to be immersive and mentally demanding so that the users will have to be completely focused on the experience and will get a complete break from their work.
    We started with an idea for the interface and further conceptualised various experiences which could be accomodated where the interactions are coherent with the experience.</p>
